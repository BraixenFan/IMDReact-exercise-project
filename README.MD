# REACT PRACTICE: THE MOVIE (The project)
## Electric boogaloo

On this repo, I will be uploading my newest practice on the React technologies, this time, I'll be taking an [an unofficial IMDb API](https://github.com/SpEcHiDe/IMDbOT) and showcasing my own webpage with the information from it.

This should help show my abilities not just with React, but also a lot with CSS, since checking the wiki of the API it seems easy to handle, those are famous last words I know, but I'll still go in with my head up.

The plan will be to make a website that shows you some movies, info about those movies and then lets you write a review on them (only storing them locally though).

It`ll be a very simple project, and if you want to check it out, you just need to clone this repo, download at least version 18.15.0 of Node.js and the React development tools if you have a chromium based browser, and then open this project in Visual Studio and run:

```
 npm install
 npm install vite@3.1.4
```
This should install everything needed for this to run, as well as care for the code if you decide to play with it yourself. If you just want to see more than just the code though, then just go into the terminal and type:
```
npm run dev
```
If it didn't automatically open a browser window for you, then open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:5173/, vite should have deployed the site to this host for you to see it, it should also tell you if the port is different, but it should be that one.
